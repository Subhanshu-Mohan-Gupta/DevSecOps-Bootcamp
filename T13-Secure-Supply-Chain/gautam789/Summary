The main goal of this project was to implement a secure software supply chain for container images by integrating signing,
attestation, and verification into a CI/CD pipeline.

Tools and technology used

GitHub Actions – For CI/CD automation.
Docker & Docker Hub – Containerization and image registry.
Cosign (Sigstore project) – For signing and verifying container images.
SLSA Provenance (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) – For generating and attaching build provenance.
in-toto concepts – To capture build process evidence.
jq & base64 – For verifying provenance outputs.


Security Achievements

Every Docker image is signed and can be verified before deployment.
Provenance ensures traceability (which commit, workflow, and builder produced the artifact).
Attestations prevent tampered or untrusted builds from being used in production.
Artifacts are archived in GitHub Actions for compliance and auditing.


Challenges Faced
missing builder field error in provenance.json.
Artifact download confusion due to GitHub permissions (404 error).
