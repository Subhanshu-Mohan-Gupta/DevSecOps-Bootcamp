## Tools Used
- **LitmusChaos**: Chaos engineering experiments
- **Falco**: Runtime security monitoring
- **Alertmanager**: Alert management and routing
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and monitoring

## Experiments Implemented
1. **Token Revocation**: Simulates authentication token compromise
2. **Network Blackhole**: Simulates network connectivity loss
3. **Pod Compromise**: Simulates pod deletion/compromise




Step 1:

Initiated a k8s cluster
Installed all the tools needed (helm,falco,Alertmanager,Prometheus)
Installed LitmusChaos for security testing

Step 2:
Intsalled Falco wiht custom rules

Step 3:
created a demo nginx web app on which we will perform the tests.

Step 4:
Wrote 3 experiments which will be performed on our sample app.

Step 5:
Then wrote respective choas engines for each experiment.

step 6:

Apllied all the experiments and engines through kubectl.

Step 7:
monitored the logs through falco

Step 8:
port forwarded the alertmanager to view alerts on UI.

Step 9:

Created a post-mortem file which summarizes the reports of experiments performed.







CHALLENGES_FACED:

Using Litmus Chaos was one of the moajor challenge I faced as It was a very new thing to me, downloading it was creating some errors but when i reinitiated te setup it worked flawlessly.
Another challenge was to understand the workflow properly that why we need engines to use experiment.
Also got some error while deploying the engines ( was getting an error of something like resource pod not found, so when I had R&D on that I found that we need to create a service account of litmus admin(through k8s rbac) to use litmus chaos tool.)
