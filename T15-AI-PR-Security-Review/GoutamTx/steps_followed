This project demonstrates integrating Snyk Code with GitHub Actions to automatically scan application code for vulnerabilities and enforce severity gates.

Snyk is a developer-first security platform that helps find, fix, and monitor vulnerabilities in:

Application code (Snyk Code â€“ static analysis)

Open source dependencies (Snyk Open Source)

Containers & images (Snyk Container)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (Terraform, Kubernetes, etc.)

It integrates directly into your CI/CD pipelines, IDEs, and GitHub/GitLab to continuously scan and provide actionable security insights.

Steps followed :-

1. Created a python project with known vulnerabilites that will be pointed by snyk.

2. installed snyk and run snyk test on our app code.

3. created a folder named reports where the outcome will be stored.

4. created the artifact and uploaded it to the repo.

5. Also worte some scripts which summarizes the report and enforce severity gates.

6. Created a github action workflow to automate the whole setup

7. For testing we created a pr and it automatically ran the workflow and pass all the checks before it can be merged.
