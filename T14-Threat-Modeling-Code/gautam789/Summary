1. Source code
  
   write source code server.py.


2. Setup Python Environment
 
   Installed Python 3.11 on the GitHub Actions runner.
   Upgraded pip, setuptools, and installed dependencies:
    threatspec (for threat modeling)
    plantuml (for diagram generation)
    markdown-mermaid (for Mermaid diagrams)


3.Prepare Output Folders
  
  Created threatmodel/ directory for JSON outputs.
  Created diagrams/ directory for UML/Mermaid diagrams.


4. Run ThreatSpec
   
   Scanned project source code for @threatspec annotations.
   Generated threat libraries and saved JSON reports in threatmodel/.
   Produced the main ThreatModel.md file (markdown report).
   Exported a PlantUML file (diagrams/dfd.puml) for the data flow diagram (DFD).


5. Generate Diagrams

   Converted dfd.puml into a PNG diagram (dfd.png).
   Created a Mermaid diagram (dfd.mmd) for visualizing flows.

6. Problems faced
    
   while installing threatspec faced version issues for python.
   Scanning server.py file from threatspec for building model.
   fixed dependency issue.
